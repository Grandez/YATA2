# Zero Lag Exponential Moving Average (ZLEMA)

This indicator was created by John Ehlers and Ric Way.[1]

As is the case with the double exponential moving average (DEMA) and the triple exponential moving average (TEMA) and as indicated by the name, the aim is to eliminate the inherent lag associated to all trend following indicators which average a price over time.

The formula for a given N-Day period and for a given data series is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Lag = (Window − 1) / 2 \\
  EmaData = Data + ( Data − Data ( Lagdaysago)) \\
   ZLEMA = EMA(EmaData, Period) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Function used in system is:

$$
ZLEMA(data, window = 10, ratio = NULL, ...)
$$
## Parametros

__window__

The Window Size is nothing but the look back period.


__ratio__

A smoothing/decay ratio. ratio overrides wilder in EMA, and provides additional smoothing in VMA.
