## Paquete

El paquete tiene imports, depends y suggests

Import es para los paquetes que se usan **dentro** del paquete
Depends es para los paquetes que se usan **en conjuncion** con el paquete

    Listing a package in either Depends or Imports ensures that it’s installed when needed. The main difference is that where Imports just loads the package, Depends attaches it. There are no other differences. [...]

    Unless there is a good reason otherwise, you should always list packages in Imports not Depends. That’s because a good package is self-contained, and minimises changes to the global environment (including the search path). The only exception is if your package is designed to be used in conjunction with another package. For example, the analogue package builds on top of vegan. It’s not useful without vegan, so it has vegan in Depends instead of Imports. Similarly, ggplot2 should really Depend on scales, rather than Importing it.
